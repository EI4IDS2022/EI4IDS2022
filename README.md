## International Workshop on Enterprise Interoperability for Industrial Data Spaces (EI4IDS 2022)
**In conjunction with the 11th International Conference on Interoperability for Enterprise Systems and Applications ([I-ESA 2022](http://i-esa2022.webs.upv.es/index.htm)) 23-25 March 2022, Valencia, Spain**

This workshop invites scholars and practitioners to submit their current work in Enterprise Interoperability applied to Industrial Data Spaces. The event will promote a discussion on how to enforce data sovereignty on technical, semantic, organizational, and legal levels of Enterprise Interoperability. The following questions will provide anchor points to discuss the advances in the area and based on the presentation of the accepted papers:
-	How could International Data Spaces enforce data sovereignty? How does it translate into business values or practical requirements?
-	How data sovereignty impacts Enterprise Interoperability on its four levels (i.e., technical, semantic, organizational, and legal)?
-	Which solution directions seem most promising to reconcile enterprises' data sharing and sovereignty demands with their actual software capabilities?  
-	How do data sovereignty-enforcing mechanisms affect trusted business relationships?
-	What best practices follow from real-world business cases in Enterprise Interoperability for IDS?
